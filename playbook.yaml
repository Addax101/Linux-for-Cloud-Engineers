# With the basic configuration in place, you can now create ansible playbooks to automate tasks on your cloud instances. A playbook is a YAML file that specifies the tasks to run and the order in which they should be run. Here is an example playbook that sets up a development environment on a cloud instance:

---
- name: Set up development environment
  hosts: cloud_instances
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install required packages
      apt:
        name:
          - git
          - python3-pip
          - python3-venv
      update_cache: true

    - name: Create virtual environment
      python_venv:
        path: /path/to/venv
        system_site_packages: false

    - name: Install requirements
      pip:
        requirements: /path/to/requirements.txt
        virtualenv: /path/to/venv



# To run this playbook, you can use the ansible-playbook command and specify the path to the playbook file i.e ansible-playbook playbooks/setup_dev_env.yml
